$Genesis='the first book of moses called genesis chapter 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters 3 and god said let there be light: and there was light 4 and god saw the light that [it was] good: and god divided the light from the darkness 5 and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day 6 ∂ and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters 7 and god made the firmament and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so 8 and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day 9 ∂ and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so 10 and god called the dry [land] earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas: and god saw that [it was] good 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed [is] in itself upon the earth: and it was so 12 and the earth brought forth grass [and] herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed [was] in itself after his kind: and god saw that [it was] good 13 and the evening and the morning were the third day 14 ∂ and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years: 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so 16 and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also 17 and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 18 and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness: and god saw that [it was] good 19 and the evening and the morning were the fourth day 20 and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven 21 and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind: and god saw that [it was] good 22 and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth 23 and the evening and the morning were the fifth day 24 ∂ and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so 25 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and god saw that [it was] good 26 ∂ and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 27 so god created man in his [own] image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them 28 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth 29 ∂ and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which [is] upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat 30 and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein [there is] life [i have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so 31 and god saw every thing that he had made and behold [it was] very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day chapter 2 1 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them 2 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 3 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made 4 ∂ these [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens 5 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew: for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and [there was] not a man to till the ground 6 but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground 7 and the lord god formed man [of] the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul 8 ∂ and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil 10 and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads 11 the name of the first [is] pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where [there is] gold 12 and the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone 13 and the name of the second river [is] gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia 14 and the name of the third river [is] hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river [is] euphrates 15 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die 18 ∂ and the lord god said [it is] not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought [them] unto adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever adam called every living creature that [was] the name thereof 20 and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof 22 and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man 23 and adam said this [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed chapter 3 1 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden 2 and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 but of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die: 5 for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil 6 and when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat 7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they [were] naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 8 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden 9 and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where [art] thou 10 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i [was] naked and i hid myself 11 and he said who told thee that thou [wast] naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat 12 and the man said the woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat 13 and the lord god said unto the woman what [is] this [that] thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou [art] cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel 16 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband and he shall rule over thee 17 and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life 18 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 19 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art] and unto dust shalt thou return 20 and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them 22 ∂ and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil: and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever: 23 therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken 24 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life chapter 4 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord 2 and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground 3 and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord 4 and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering: 5 but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell 6 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen 7 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee [shall be] his desire and thou shalt rule over him 8 and cain talked with abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him 9 ∂ and the lord said unto cain where [is] abel thy brother and he said i know not: [am] i my brothers keeper 10 and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground 11 and now [art] thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand 12 when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth 13 and cain said unto the lord my punishment [is] greater than i can bear 14 behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass [that] every one that findeth me shall slay me 15 and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him 16 ∂ and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden 17 and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch: and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch 18 and unto enoch was born irad: and irad begat mehujael: and mehujael begat methusael: and methusael begat lamech 19 ∂ and lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one [was] adah and the name of the other zillah 20 and adah bare jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [of such as have] cattle 21 and his brothers name [was] jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ 22 and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of tubalcain [was] naamah 23 and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech: for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt 24 if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold 25 ∂ and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth: for god [said she] hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew 26 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos: then began men to call upon the name of the lord chapter 5 1 this [is] the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made

the earth and daughters were born unto them 2 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair and they took them wives of all which they chose 3 and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years 4 there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare [children] to them the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old men of renown 5 ∂ and god saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually 6 and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart 7 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them 8 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord 9 ∂ these [are] the generations of noah: noah was a just man [and] perfect in his generations [and] noah walked with god 10 and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth 11 the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence 12 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth 13 and god said

flood of waters was upon the earth 7 ∂ and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood 8 of clean beasts and of beasts that [are] not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 9 there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah 10 and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth 11 ∂ in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened 12 and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights 13 in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark 14 they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort 15 and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein [is] the breath of life 16 and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him: and the lord shut him in 17 and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth 18 and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters 19 and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that [were] under the whole heaven were covered 20 fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered 21 and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man: 22 all in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life of all that [was] in the dry [land] died 23 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth: and noah only remained [alive] and they that [were] with him in the ark 24 and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days chapter 8 1 and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged 2 the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained 3 and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated 4 and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat 5 and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month] on the first [day] of the month were the tops of the mountains seen 6 ∂ and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 7 and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth 8 also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground 9 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark 10 and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark 11 and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth 12 and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more 13 ∂ and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first [month] the first [day] of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth: and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry 14 and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried 15 ∂ and god spake unto noah saying 16 go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee 17 bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee of all flesh [both] of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth 18 and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him: 19 every beast every creeping thing and every fowl [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark 20 ∂ and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar 21 and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart [is] evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done 22 while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease chapter 9 1 and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 2 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth [upon] the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered 3 every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things 4 but flesh with the life thereof [which is] the blood thereof shall ye not eat 5 and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man 6 whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of god made he man 7 and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein 8 ∂ and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying 9 and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you 10 and with every living creature that [is] with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth 11 and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth 12 and god said this [is] the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you for perpetual generations: 13 i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth 14 and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 and i will remember my covenant which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh 16 and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant

nations 32 these [are] the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood chapter 11 1 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 2 and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there 3 and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them throughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter 4 and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top [may reach] unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth 5 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded 6 and the lord said behold the people [is] one and they have all one language and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do 7 go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech 8 so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city 9 therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth 10 ∂ these [are] the generations of shem: shem [was] an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood: 11 and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters 12 and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah: 13 and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 14 and salah lived thirty years and begat eber: 15 and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 16 and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg: 17 and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters 18 and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu: 19 and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters 20 and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug: 21 and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters 22 and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor: 23 and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters 24 and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah: 25 and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters 26 and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran 27 ∂ now these [are] the generations of terah: terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot 28 and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees 29 and abram and nahor took them wives: the name of abrams wife [was] sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah 30 but sarai was barren she [had] no child 31 and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughter in law his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there 32 and the days of terah were two hundred and five years: and terah died in haran chapter 12 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i will shew thee: 2 and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing: 3 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed 4 so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him: and abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran 5 and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came 6 ∂ and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite [was] then in the land 7 and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him 8 and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent [having] bethel on the west and hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord 9 and abram journeyed going on still toward the south 10 ∂ and there was a famine in the land: and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine [was] grievous in the land 11 and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon: 12 therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this [is] his wife: and they will kill me but they will save thee alive 13 say i pray thee thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee 14 ∂ and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair 15 the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh: and the woman was taken into pharaohs house 16 and he entreated abram well for her sake: and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels 17 and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife 18 and pharaoh called abram and said what [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife 19 why saidst thou she [is] my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife take [her] and go thy way 20 and pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had chapter 13 1 and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south 2 and abram [was] very rich in cattle in silver and in gold 3 and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai 4 unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first: and there abram called on the name of the lord 5 ∂ and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents 6 and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together: for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together 7 and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle: and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land 8 and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we [be] brethren 9 [is] not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand then i will go to the right or if [thou depart] to the right hand then i will go to the left 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it [was] well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah [even] as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar 11 then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other 12 abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched [his] tent toward sodom 13 but the men of sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly 14 ∂ and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward: 15 for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever 16 and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth [then] shall thy seed also be numbered 17 arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee 18 then abram removed [his] tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which [is] in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord chapter 14 1 and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations 2 [that these] made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar 3 all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea 4 twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled 5 and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that [were] with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim 6 and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which [is] by the wilderness 7 and they returned and came to enmishpat which [is] kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar 8 and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela (the same [is] zoar) and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim 9 with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five 10 and the vale of siddim [was full of] slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain 11 and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way 12 and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed 13 and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner: and these [were] confederate with abram 14 and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained [servants] born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued [them] unto dan 15 and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which [is] on the left hand of damascus 16 and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people 17 ∂ and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that [were] with him at the valley of shaveh which [is] the kings dale 18 and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was] the priest of the most high god 19 and he blessed him and said blessed [be] abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth: 20 and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all 21 and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself 22 and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth 23 that i will not [take] from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that [is] thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich: 24 save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion chapter 15 1 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram: i [am] thy shield [and] thy exceeding great reward 2 and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house [is] this eliezer of damascus 3 and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed: and lo one born in my house is mine heir 4 and behold the word of the lord [came] unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir 5 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him so shall thy seed be 6 and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness 7 and he said unto him i [am] the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it 8 and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it 9 and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon 10 and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not 11 and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away 12 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him 13 and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years 14 and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance 15 and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age 16 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the amorites [is] not yet full 17 and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces 18 in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates: 19 the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites 20 and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims 21 and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites chapter 16 1 now sarai abrams wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name [was] hagar 2 and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing: i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai 3 and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife 4 ∂ and he went in unto hagar and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes 5 and sarai said unto abram my wrong [be] upon thee: i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes: the lord judge between me and thee 6 but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid [is] in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face 7 ∂ and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur 8 and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai 9 and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands 10 and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude 11 and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou [art] with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction 12 and he will be a wild man his hand [will be] against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren 13 and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me: for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me 14 wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold [it is] between kadesh and bered 15 ∂ and hagar bare abram a son: and abram called his sons name which hagar bare ishmael 16 and abram [was] fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram chapter 17 1 and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i [am] the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect 2 and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly 3 and abram fell on his face: and god talked with him saying 4 as for me behold my covenant [is] with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations 5 neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee 6 and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee 7 and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee 8 and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god 9 ∂ and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations 10 this [is] my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised 11 and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you 12 and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which [is] not of thy seed 13 he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant 14 and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant 15 ∂ and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah [shall] her name [be] 16 and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her: yea i will bless her and she shall be [a mother] of nations kings of people shall be of her 17 then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear 18 and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee 19 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac: and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant [and] with his seed after him 20 and as for ishmael i have heard thee: behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation 21 but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year 22 and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham 23 ∂ and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him 24 and abraham [was] ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 25 and ishmael his son [was] thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 26 in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son 27 and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him chapter 18 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day 2 and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him: and when he saw [them] he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground 3 and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant: 4 let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree: 5 and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said 6 and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead [it] and make cakes upon the hearth 7 and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave [it] unto a young man and he hasted to dress it 8 and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set [it] before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat 9 ∂ and they said unto him where [is] sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent 10 and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard [it] in the tent door which [was] behind him 11 now abraham and sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age [and] it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women 12 therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also 13 and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old 14 is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son 15 then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh 16 ∂ and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom: and abraham went with them to bring them on the way 17 and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do 18 seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him 19 for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him 20 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous 21 i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know 22 and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom: but abraham stood yet before the lord 23 ∂ and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked 24 peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein 25 that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee: shall not the judge of all the earth do right 26 and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes 27 and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which [am but] dust and ashes: 28 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy [it] 29 and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do [it] for fortys sake 30 and he said [unto him] oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do [it] if i find thirty there 31 and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy [it] for twentys sake 32 and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy [it] for tens sake 33 and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham: and abraham returned unto his place chapter 19 1 and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom: and lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground 2 and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night 3 and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat 4 ∂ but before they lay down the men of the city [even] the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter: 5 and they called unto lot and said unto him where [are] the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them 6 and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him 7 and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly 8 behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof 9 and they said stand back and they said [again] this one [fellow] came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man [even] lot and came near to break the door 10 but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door 11 and they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door 12 ∂ and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring [them] out of this place: 13 for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it 14 and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law 15 ∂ and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city 16 and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth and set him without the city 17 ∂ and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed 18 and lot said unto them oh not so my lord: 19 behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die: 20 behold now this city [is] near to flee unto and it [is] a little one: oh let me escape thither ([is] it not a little one) and my soul shall live 21 and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken 22 haste thee escape thither for i cannot do any thing till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar 23 ∂ the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar 24 then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven 25 and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground 26 ∂ but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt 27 ∂ and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord: 28 and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace 29 ∂ and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt 30 ∂ and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar: and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters 31 and the firstborn said unto the younger our father [is] old and [there is] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 32 come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 33 and they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 34 and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in [and] lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 35 and they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 36 thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father 37 and the firstborn bare a son and called his name moab: the same [is] the father of the moabites unto this day 38 and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of ammon unto this day chapter 20 1 and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar 2 and abraham said of sarah his wife she [is] my sister: and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah 3 but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou [art but] a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she [is] a mans wife 4 but abimelech had not come near her: and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation 5 said he not unto me she [is] my sister and she even she herself said he [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this 6 and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered i thee not to touch her 7 now therefore restore the man [his] wife for he [is] a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that [are] thine 8 therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid 9 then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done 10 and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing 11 and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god [is] not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake 12 and yet indeed [she is] my sister she [is] the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 13 and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this [is] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he [is] my brother 14 and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave [them] unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife 15 and abimelech said behold my land [is] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee 16 and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that [are] with thee and with all [other]: thus she was reproved 17 ∂ so abraham prayed unto god: and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare [children] 18 for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife chapter 21 1 and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken 2 for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him 3 and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac 4 and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him 5 and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him 6 ∂ and sarah said god hath made me to laugh [so that] all that hear will laugh with me 7 and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born [him] a son in his old age 8 and the child grew and was weaned: and abraham made a great feast the [same] day that isaac was weaned 9 ∂ and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking 10 wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son [even] with isaac 11 and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because of his son 12 ∂ and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called 13 and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he [is] thy seed 14 and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave [it] unto hagar putting [it] on her shoulder and the child and sent her away: and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba 15 and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs 16 and she went and sat her down over against [him] a good way off as it were a bowshot: for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against [him] and lift up her voice and wept 17 and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is] 18 arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation 19 and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink 20 and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer 21 and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt 22 ∂ and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god [is] with thee in all that thou doest: 23 now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son: [but] according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned 24 and abraham said i will swear 25 and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away 26 and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i [of it] but to day 27 and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant 28 and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves 29 and abimelech said unto abraham what [mean] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves 30 and he said for [these] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well 31 wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them 32 thus they made a covenant at beersheba: then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines 33 ∂ and [abraham] planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god 34 and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days chapter 22 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham: and he said behold [here] i [am] 2 and he said take now thy son thine only [son] isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of 3 and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him 4 then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off 5 and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid [it] upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together 7 and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father: and he said here [am] i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering 8 and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together 9 and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood 10 and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son 11 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham: and he said here [am] i 12 and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him: for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only [son] from me 13 and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind [him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son 14 and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh: as it is said [to] this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen 15 ∂ and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time 16 and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only [son]: 17 that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which [is] upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice 19 so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba 20 ∂ and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor 21 huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram 22 and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel 23 and bethuel begat rebekah: these eight milcah did bear to nahor abrahams brother 24 and his concubine whose name [was] reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah chapter 23 1 and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: [these were] the years of the life of sarah 2 and sarah died in kirjatharba the same [is] hebron in the land of canaan: and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her 3 ∂ and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying 4 i [am] a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight 5 and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him 6 hear us my lord: thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead 7 and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land [even] to the children of heth 8 and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar 9 that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which [is] in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you 10 and ephron dwelt among the children of heth: and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city saying 11 nay my lord hear me: the field give i thee and the cave that [is] therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee: bury thy dead 12 and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land 13 and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou [wilt give it] i pray thee hear me: i will give thee money for the field take [it] of me and i will bury my dead there 14 and ephron answered abraham saying unto him 15 my lord hearken unto me: the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver what [is] that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead 16 and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current [money] with the merchant 17 ∂ and the field of ephron which [was] in machpelah which [was] before mamre the field and the cave which [was] therein and all the trees that [were] in the field that [were] in all the borders round about were made sure 18 unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city 19 and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre: the same [is] hebron in the land of canaan 20 and the field and the cave that [is] therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth chapter 24 1 and abraham was old [and] well stricken in age: and the lord had blessed abraham in all things 2 and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh: 3 and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell: 4 but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac 5 and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest 6 and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again 7 ∂ the lord god of heaven which took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence 8 and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again 9 and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter 10 ∂ and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master [were] in his hand: and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor 11 and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening [even] the time that women go out to draw [water] 12 and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham 13 behold i stand [here] by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 14 and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master 15 ∂ and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder 16 and the damsel [was] very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up 17 and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher 18 and she said drink my lord: and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink 19 and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw [water] for thy camels also until they have done drinking 20 and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw [water] and drew for all his camels 21 and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not 22 and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten [shekels] weight of gold 23 and said whose daughter [art] thou tell me i pray thee: is there room [in] thy fathers house for us to lodge in 24 and she said unto him i [am] the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor 25 she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in 26 and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord 27 and he said blessed [be] the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: i [being] in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren 28 and the damsel ran and told [them of] her mothers house these things 29 ∂ and rebekah had a brother and his name [was] laban: and laban ran out unto the man unto the well 30 and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well 31 and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels 32 ∂ and the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that [were] with him 33 and there was set [meat] before him to eat: but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on 34 and he said i [am] abrahams servant 35 and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses 36 and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath 37 and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell: 38 but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son 39 and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me 40 and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house: 41 then shalt thou be clear from [this] my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee [one] thou shalt be clear from my oath 42 and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go: 43 behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw [water] and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink 44 and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels: [let] the same [be] the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters son 45 and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew [water]: and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee 46 and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder] and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also: so i drank and she made the camels drink also 47 and i asked her and said whose daughter [art] thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him: and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands 48 and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son 49 and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me: and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left 50 then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good 51 behold rebekah [is] before thee take [her] and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken 52 and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the lord [bowing himself] to the earth 53 and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave [them] to rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things 54 and they did eat and drink he and the men that [were] with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master 55 and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us [a few] days at the least ten after that she shall go 56 and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master 57 and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth 58 and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go 59 and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men 60 and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou [art] our sister be thou [the mother] of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them 61 ∂ and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man: and the servant took rebekah and went his way 62 and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country 63 and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels [were] coming 64 and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel 65 for she [had] said unto the servant what man [is] this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant [had] said it [is] my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself 66 and the servant told isaac all things that he had done 67 and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her: and isaac was comforted after his mothers [death] chapter 25 1 then again abraham took a wife and her name [was] keturah 2 and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah 3 and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were

his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which [is] before mamre 10 the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth:

towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations 17 and these [are] the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people 18 and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that [is] before egypt as thou goest toward assyria: [and] he died in the presence of all his brethren 19 ∂ and these [are] the generations of isaac abrahams son: abraham begat isaac: 20 and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian 21 and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she [was] barren: and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived 22 and the children struggled together within her and she said if [it be] so why [am] i thus and she went to enquire of the lord 23 and the lord said unto her two nations [are] in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people and the elder shall serve the younger 24 ∂ and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold [there were] twins in her womb 25 and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau 26 and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob: and isaac [was] threescore years old when she bare them 27 and the boys grew: and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob [was] a plain man dwelling in tents 28 and isaac loved esau because he did eat of [his] venison: but rebekah loved jacob 29 and jacob sod pottage: and esau came from the field and he [was] faint: 30 and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red [pottage] for i [am] faint: therefore was his name called edom 31 and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright 32 and esau said behold i [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me 33 and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto jacob 34 then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way: thus esau despised [his] birthright chapter 26 1 and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar 2 and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of: 3 sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father 4 and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed 5 because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws 6 ∂

for rebekah because she [was] fair to look upon 8 and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac [was] sporting with rebekah his wife 9 and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou she [is] my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her 10 and abimelech said what [is] this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us 11 and abimelech charged all [his] people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death 12 then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the lord blessed him 13 and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great: 14 for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants: and the philistines envied him 15 for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth 16 and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we 17 ∂ and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there 18 and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them 19 and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water 20 and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmen saying the water [is] ours: and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him 21 and they digged another well and strove for that also: and he called the name of it sitnah 22 and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land 23 and he went up from thence to beersheba 24 and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i [am] the god of abraham thy father: fear not for i [am] with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake 25 and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there: and there isaacs servants digged a well 26 ∂ then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army 27 and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you 28 and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee: and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us [even] betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee 29 that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the lord 30 and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink 31 and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another: and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace 32 and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water

called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son: and he said unto him behold [here am] i 2 and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death: 3 now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me [some] venison 4 and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring [it] to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die

speak unto esau thy brother saying 7 bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death 8 now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee 9 go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth: 10 and thou shalt bring [it] to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death 11 and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother [is] a hairy man and i [am] a smooth man: 12 my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing 13 and his mother said unto him upon me [be] thy curse my son: only obey my voice and go fetch me [them] 14 and he went and fetched and brought [them] to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved 15 and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which [were] with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son: 16 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck: 17 and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob 18 ∂ and he came unto his father and said my father: and he said here [am] i who [art] thou my son 19 and jacob said unto his father i [am] esau thy firstborn i have done according as thou badest me: arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me 20 and isaac said unto his son how [is it] that thou hast found [it] so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought [it] to me 21 and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou [be] my very son esau or not 22 and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice [is] jacobs voice but the hands [are] the hands of esau 23 and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands: so he blessed him 24 and he said [art] thou my very son esau and he said i [am] 25 and he said bring [it] near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought [it] near to him and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank 26 and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son 27 and he came near and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed: 28 therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine: 29 let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee: cursed [be] every one that curseth thee and blessed [be] he that blesseth thee 30 ∂ and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting 31 and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me 32 and isaac his father said unto him who [art] thou and he said i [am] thy son thy firstborn esau 33 and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where [is] he that hath taken venison and brought [it] me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea [and] he shall be blessed 34 and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me [even] me also o my father 35 and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing 36 and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me 37 and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him: and what shall i do now unto thee my son 38 and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me [even] me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept 39 and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above 40 and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck 41 ∂ and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob 42 and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah: and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself [purposing] to kill thee 43 now therefore my son obey my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran 44 and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away 45 until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then i will send and fetch thee from thence: why should i be deprived also of you both in one day 46 and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth: if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me chapter 28 1 and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 2 arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mothers brother 3 and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people 4 and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham 5 and isaac sent away jacob: and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother 6 ∂ when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 7 and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram 8 and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father 9 then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife 10 ∂ and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran 11 and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put [them for] his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep 12 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it 13 and behold the lord stood above it and said i [am] the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac: the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed 14 and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed 15 and behold i [am] with thee and will keep thee in all [places] whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done [that] which i have spoken to thee of 16 ∂ and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew [it] not 17 and he was afraid and said how dreadful [is] this place this [is] none other but the house of god and this [is] the gate of heaven 18 and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put [for] his pillows and set it up [for] a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it 19 and he called the name of that place bethel: but the name of that city [was called] luz at the first 20 and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on 21 so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god: 22 and this stone which i have set [for] a pillar shall be gods house: and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee chapter 29 1 then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east 2 and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone [was] upon the wells mouth 3 and thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place 4 and jacob said unto them my brethren whence [be] ye and they said of haran [are] we 5 and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know [him] 6 and he said unto them [is] he well and they said [he is] well: and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep 7 and he said lo [it is] yet high day neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep and go [and] feed [them] 8 and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and [till] they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep 9 ∂ and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fathers sheep: for she kept them 10 and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother 11 and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept 12 and jacob told rachel that he [was] her fathers brother and that he [was] rebekahs son: and she ran and told her father 13 and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things 14 and laban said to him surely thou [art] my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month 15 ∂ and laban said unto jacob because thou [art] my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what [shall] thy wages [be] 16 and laban had two daughters: the name of the elder [was] leah and the name of the younger [was] rachel 17 leah [was] tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured 18 and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter 19 and laban said [it is] better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man: abide with me 20 and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him [but] a few days for the love he had to her 21 ∂ and jacob said unto laban give [me] my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her 22 and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast 23 and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her 24 and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid [for] an handmaid 25 and it came to pass that in the morning behold it [was] leah: and he said to laban what [is] this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me 26 and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn 27 fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years 28 and jacob did so and fulfilled her week: and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also 29 and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid 30 and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years 31 ∂ and when the lord saw that leah [was] hated he opened her womb: but rachel [was] barren 32 and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben: for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me 33 and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard that i [was] hated he hath therefore given me this [son] also: and she called his name simeon 34 and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons: therefore was his name called levi 35 and she conceived again and bare a son: and she said now will i praise the lord: therefore she called his name judah and left bearing chapter 30 1 and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die 2 and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel: and he said [am] i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb 3 and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her 4 and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife: and jacob went in unto her 5 and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son 6 and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name dan 7 and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son 8 and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed: and she called his name naphtali 9 when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife 10 and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son 11 and leah said a troop cometh: and she called his name gad 12 and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son 13 and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name asher 14 ∂ and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes 15 and she said unto her [is it] a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes 16 and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night 17 and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son 18 and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name issachar 19 and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son 20 and leah said god hath endued me [with] a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons: and she called his name zebulun 21 and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah 22 ∂ and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb 23 and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach: 24 and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son 25 ∂ and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country 26 give [me] my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go: for thou knowest my service which i have done thee 27 and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes [tarry: for] i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake 28 and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give [it] 29 and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me 30 for [it was] little which thou hadst before i [came] and it is [now] increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall i provide for mine own house also 31 and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed [and] keep thy flock: 32 i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire 33 so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me 34 and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word 35 and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted [and] every one that had [some] white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave [them] into the hand of his sons 36 and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob: and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks 37 ∂ and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which [was] in the rods 38 and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink 39 and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted 40 and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto labans cattle 41 and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods 42 but when the cattle were feeble he put [them] not in: so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs 43 and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses chapter 31 1 and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that [was] our fathers and of [that] which [was] our fathers hath he gotten all this glory 2 and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it [was] not toward him as before 3 and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee 4 and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock 5 and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it [is] not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me 6 and ye know that with all my power i have served your father 7 and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me 8 if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked 9 thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given [them] to me 10 and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle [were] ringstraked speckled and grisled 11 and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream [saying] jacob: and i said here [am] i 12 and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle [are] ringstraked speckled and grisled: for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee 13 i [am] the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar [and] where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred 14 and rachel and leah answered and said unto him [is there] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house 15 are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money 16 for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that [is] ours and our childrens: now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do 17 ∂ then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels 18 and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan 19 and laban went to shear his sheep: and rachel had stolen the images that [were] her fathers 20 and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled 21 so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face [toward] the mount gilead 22 and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled 23 and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead 24 and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 25 ∂ then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead 26 and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives [taken] with the sword 27 wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp 28 and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in [so] doing 29 it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 30 and now [though] thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods 31 and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid: for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me 32 with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what [is] thine with me and take [it] to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them 33 and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found [them] not then went he out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent 34 now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found [them] not 35 and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women [is] upon me and he searched but found not the images 36 ∂ and jacob was wroth and chode with laban: and jacob answered and said to laban what [is] my trespass what [is] my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me 37 whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both 38 this twenty years [have] i [been] with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten 39 that which was torn [of beasts] i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it [whether] stolen by day or stolen by night 40 [thus] i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes 41 thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times 42 except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked [thee] yesternight 43 ∂ and laban answered and said unto jacob [these] daughters [are] my daughters and [these] children [are] my children and [these] cattle [are] my cattle and all that thou seest [is] mine: and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born 44 now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee 45 and jacob took a stone and set it up [for] a pillar 46 and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap 47 and laban called it jegarsahadutha: but jacob called it galeed 48 and laban said this heap [is] a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed 49 and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another 50 if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take [other] wives beside my daughters no man [is] with us see god [is] witness betwixt me and thee 51 and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold [this] pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee 52 this heap [be] witness and [this] pillar [be] witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm 53 the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac 54 then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount 55 and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them: and laban departed and returned unto his place chapter 32 1 and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him 2 and when jacob saw them he said this [is] gods host: and he called the name of that place mahanaim 3 and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom 4 and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now: 5 and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants: and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight 6 ∂ and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him 7 then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that [was] with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands 8 and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape 9 ∂ and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee: 10 i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands 11 deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau: for i fear him lest he will come and smite me [and] the mother with the children 12 and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude 13 ∂ and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother 14 two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams 15 thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals 16 and he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove 17 and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose [art] thou and whither goest thou and whose [are] these before thee 18 then thou shalt say [they be] thy servant jacobs it [is] a present sent unto my lord esau: and behold also he [is] behind us 19 and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him 20 and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob [is] behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me 21 so went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company 22 and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok 23 and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had 24 ∂ and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day 25 and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him 26 and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me 27 and he said unto him what [is] thy name and he said jacob 28 and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel: for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed 29 and jacob asked [him] and said tell [me] i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there 30 and jacob called the name of the place peniel: for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved 31 and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh 32 therefore the children of israel eat not [of] the sinew which shrank which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day: because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank chapter 33 1 and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids 2 and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost 3 and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother 4 and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him: and they wept 5 and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who [are] those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant 6 then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves 7 and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves: and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves 8 and he said what [meanest] thou by all this drove which i met and he said [these are] to find grace in the sight of my lord 9 and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself 10 and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand: for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me 11 take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took [it] 12 and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee 13 and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children [are] tender and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die 14 let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant: and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir 15 and esau said let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord 16 ∂ so esau returned that day on his way unto seir 17 and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called succoth 18 ∂ and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which [is] in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city 19 and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred pieces of money 20 and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael chapter 34 1 and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land 2 and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her 3 and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel 4 and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife 5 and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and jacob held his peace until they were come 6 ∂ and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him 7 and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard [it]: and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done 8 and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter: i pray you give her him to wife 9 and make ye marriages with us [and] give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you 10 and ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein 11 and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give 12 ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife 13 and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister: 14 and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that [were] a reproach unto us: 15 but in this will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we [be] that every male of you be circumcised 16 then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people 17 but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone 18 and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son 19 and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter: and he [was] more honourable than all the house of his father 20 ∂ and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying 21 these men [are] peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold [it is] large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters 22 only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they [are] circumcised 23 [shall] not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs [be] ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us 24 and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city 25 ∂ and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males 26 and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went out 27 the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister 28 they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which [was] in the city and that which [was] in the field 29 and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that [was] in the house 30 and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites: and i [being] few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house 31 and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot chapter 35 1 and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there: and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother 2 then jacob said unto his household and to all that [were] with him put away the strange gods that [are] among you and be clean and change your garments: 3 and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went 4 and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by shechem 5 and they journeyed: and the terror of god was upon the cities that [were] round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob 6 ∂ so jacob came to luz which [is] in the land of canaan that [is] bethel he and all the people that [were] with him 7 and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel: because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother 8 but deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called allonbachuth 9 ∂ and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him 10 and god said unto him thy name [is] jacob: thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name: and he called his name israel 11 and god said unto him i [am] god almighty: be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins 12 and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land 13 and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him 14 and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him [even] a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon 15 and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel 16 ∂ and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath: and rachel travailed and she had hard labour 17 and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also 18 and it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name benoni: but his father called him benjamin 19 and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which [is] bethlehem 20 and jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of rachels grave unto this day 21 ∂ and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar 22 and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his fathers concubine: and israel heard [it] now the sons of jacob were twelve: 23 the sons of leah reuben jacobs firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun: 24 the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin: 25 and the sons of bilhah rachels handmaid dan and naphtali: 26 and the sons of zilpah leahs handmaid gad and asher: these [are] the sons of jacob which were born to him in padanaram 27 ∂ and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre unto the city of arbah which [is] hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned 28 and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years 29 and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people [being] old and full of days: and his sons esau and jacob buried him chapter 36 1 now these [are] the generations of esau who [is] edom 2 esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and aholibamah the daughter

beasts and all his substance which he had got in the land of canaan and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob 7 for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle 8 thus dwelt esau in mount seir: esau [is] edom 9 ∂ and these [are] the generations of esau the father of the edomites

jacob joseph [being] seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad [was] with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives: and joseph brought unto his father their evil report 3 now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he [was] the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of [many] colours 4 and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him 5 ∂ and joseph dreamed a dream and he told [it] his brethren: and they hated him yet the more 6 and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed: 7 for behold we [were] binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf 8 and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words 9 ∂ and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me 10 and he told [it] to his father and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him and said unto him what [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth 11 and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying 12 ∂ and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem 13 and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed [the flock] in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here [am i] 14 and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem 15 ∂ and a certain man found him and behold [he was] wandering in the field: and the man asked him saying what seekest thou 16 and he said i seek my brethren: tell me i pray thee where they feed [their flocks] 17 and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan 18 and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him 19 and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh 20 come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams 21 and reuben heard [it] and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him 22 and reuben said unto them shed no blood [but] cast him into this pit that [is] in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again 23 ∂ and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript joseph out of his coat [his] coat of [many] colours that [was] on him 24 and they took him and cast him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty [there was] no water in it 25 and they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry [it] down to egypt 26 and judah said unto his brethren what profit [is it] if we slay our brother and conceal his blood 27 come and let us sell him to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he [is] our brother [and] our flesh and his brethren were content 28 then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought joseph into egypt 29 ∂ and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph [was] not in the pit and he rent his clothes 30 and he returned unto his brethren and said the child [is] not and i whither shall i go 31 and they took josephs coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood 32 and they sent the coat of [many] colours and they brought [it] to their father and said this have we found: know now whether it [be] thy sons coat or no 33 and he knew it and said [it is] my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces 34 and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days 35 and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him 36 and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs [and] captain of the guard chapter 38 1 and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name [was] hirah 2 and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name [was] shuah and he took her and went in unto her 3 and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er 4 and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan 5 and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah: and he was at chezib when she bare him 6 and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name [was] tamar 7 and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him 8 and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother 9 and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled [it] on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother 10 and the thing which he did displeased the lord: wherefore he slew him also 11 then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown: for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren [did] and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house 12 ∂ and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite 13 and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep 14 and she put her widows garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which [is] by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife 15 when judah saw her he thought her [to be] an harlot because she had covered her face 16 and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter in law) and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me 17 and he said i will send [thee] a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give [me] a pledge till thou send [it] 18 and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that [is] in thine hand and he gave [it] her and came in unto her and she conceived by him 19 and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood 20 and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive [his] pledge from the womans hand: but he found her not 21 then he asked the men of that place saying where [is] the harlot that [was] openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this [place] 22 and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said [that] there was no harlot in this [place] 23 and judah said let her take [it] to her lest we be shamed: behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her 24 ∂ and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she [is] with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt 25 when she [was] brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these [are am] i with child: and she said discern i pray thee whose [are] these the signet and bracelets and staff 26 and judah acknowledged [them] and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more 27 ∂ and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins [were] in her womb 28 and it came to pass when she travailed that [the one] put out [his] hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first 29 and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out: and she said how hast thou broken forth [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called pharez 30 and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called zarah chapter 39 1 and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither 2 and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian 3 and his master saw that the lord [was] with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand 4 and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house and all [that] he had he put into his hand 5 and it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field 6 and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was [a] goodly [person] and well favoured 7 ∂ and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me 8 but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master wotteth not what [is] with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand 9 [there is] none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou [art] his wife: how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god 10 and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her [or] to be with her 11 and it came to pass about this time that [joseph] went into the house to do his business and [there was] none of the men of the house there within 12 and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out 13 and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth 14 that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice: 15 and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out 16 and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home 17 and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me: 18 and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out 19 and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled 20 and josephs master took him and put him into the prison a place where the kings prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison 21 ∂ but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison 22 and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer [of it] 23 the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [that was] under his hand because the lord was with him and [that] which he did the lord made [it] to prosper chapter 40 1 and it came to pass after these things [that] the butler of the king of egypt and [his] baker had offended their lord the king of egypt 2 and pharaoh was wroth against two [of] his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers 3 and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph [was] bound 4 and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them: and they continued a season in ward 5 ∂ and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which [were] bound in the prison 6 and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they [were] sad 7 and he asked pharaohs officers that [were] with him in the ward of his lords house saying wherefore look ye [so] sadly to day 8 and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and [there is] no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them [do] not interpretations [belong] to god tell me [them] i pray you 9 and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine [was] before me 10 and in the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as though it budded [and] her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 11 and pharaohs cup [was] in my hand: and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand 12 and joseph said unto him this [is] the interpretation of it: the three branches [are] three days: 13 yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler 14 but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house: 15 for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews: and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon 16 when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also [was] in my dream and behold [i had] three white baskets on my head: 17 and in the uppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head 18 and joseph answered and said this [is] the interpretation thereof: the three baskets [are] three days: 19 yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee 20 ∂ and it came to pass the third day [which was] pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants 21 and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand: 22 but he hanged the chief baker: as joseph had interpreted to them 23 yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him chapter 41 1 and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed: and behold he stood by the river 2 and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow 3 and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river 4 and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke 5 and he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good 6 and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 7 and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold [it was] a dream 8 and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof: and pharaoh told them his dream but [there was] none that could interpret them unto pharaoh 9 ∂ then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day: 10 pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guards house [both] me and the chief baker: 11 and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream 12 and [there was] there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret 13 and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged 14 ∂ then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself] and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh 15 and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and [there is] none that can interpret it: and i have heard say of thee [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it 16 and joseph answered pharaoh saying [it is] not in me: god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace 17 and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river: 18 and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow: 19 and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness: 20 and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 21 and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they [were] still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke 22 and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good: 23 and behold seven ears withered thin [and] blasted with the east wind sprung up after them: 24 and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and i told [this] unto the magicians but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me 25 and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh [is] one: god hath shewed pharaoh what he [is] about to do 26 the seven good kine [are] seven years and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one 27 and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine 28 this [is] the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh: what god [is] about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh 29 behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt: 30 and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land 31 and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it [shall be] very grievous 32 and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice [it is] because the thing [is] established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass 33 now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt 34 let pharaoh do [this] and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years 35 and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities 36 and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine 37 ∂ and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants 38 and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find [such a one] as this [is] a man in whom the spirit of god [is] 39 and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]: 40 thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will i be greater than thou 41 and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt 42 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck 43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of egypt 44 and pharaoh said unto joseph i [am] pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt 45 and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over [all] the land of egypt 46 ∂ and joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt 47 and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls 48 and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which [was] round about every city laid he up in the same 49 and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for [it was] without number 50 and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him 51 and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh: for god [said he] hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house 52 and the name of the second called he ephraim: for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction 53 ∂ and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended 54 and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread 55 and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread: and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do 56 and the famine was over all the face of the earth: and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt 57 and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy [corn] because that the famine was [so] sore in all lands chapter 42 1 now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another 2 and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt: get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die 3 ∂ and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt 4 but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him 5 and the sons of israel came to buy [corn] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of canaan 6 and joseph [was] the governor over the land [and] he [it was] that sold to all the people of the land: and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him [with] their faces to the earth 7 and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food 8 and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him 9 and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye [are] spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come 10 and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come 11 we [are] all one mans sons we [are] true [men] thy servants are no spies 12 and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come 13 and they said thy servants [are] twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest [is] this day with our father and one [is] not 14 and joseph said unto them that [is it] that i spake unto you saying ye [are] spies: 15 hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither 16 send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether [there be any] truth in you: or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye [are] spies 17 and he put them all together into ward three days 18 and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live [for] i fear god: 19 if ye [be] true [men] let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses: 20 but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so 21 ∂ and they said one to another we [are] verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us 22 and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required 23 and they knew not that joseph understood [them] for he spake unto them by an interpreter 24 and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes 25 ∂ then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them 26 and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence 27 and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it [was] in his sacks mouth 28 and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them] and they were afraid saying one to another what [is] this [that] god hath done unto us 29 ∂ and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying 30 the man [who is] the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country 31 and we said unto him we [are] true [men] we are no spies: 32 we [be] twelve brethren sons of our father one [is] not and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of canaan 33 and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye [are] true [men] leave one of your brethren [here] with me and take [food for] the famine of your households and be gone: 34 and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall i know that ye [are] no spies but [that] ye [are] true [men: so] will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land 35 ∂ and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money [was] in his sack: and when [both] they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid 36 and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved [of my children]: joseph [is] not and simeon [is] not and ye will take benjamin [away]: all these things are against me 37 and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again 38 and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave chapter 43 1 and the famine [was] sore in the land 2 and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food 3 and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother [be] with you 4 if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food: 5 but if thou wilt not send [him] we will not go down: for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother [be] with you 6 and israel said wherefore dealt ye [so] ill with me [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother 7 and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying [is] your father yet alive have ye [another] brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down 8 and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou [and] also our little ones 9 i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him: if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever: 10 for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time 11 and their father israel said unto them if [it must be] so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds: 12 and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry [it] again in your hand peradventure it [was] an oversight: 13 take also your brother and arise go again unto the man: 14 and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved [of my children] i am bereaved 15 and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph 16 and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring [these] men home and slay and make ready for [these] men shall dine with me at noon 17 and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into josephs house 18 and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses 19 and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they communed with him at the door of the house 20 and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 21 and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold [every] mans money [was] in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand 22 and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks 23 and he said peace [be] to you fear not: your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks: i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them 24 and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave [them] water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender 25 and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there 26 ∂ and when joseph came home they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth 27 and he asked them of [their] welfare and said [is] your father well the old man of whom ye spake [is] he yet alive 28 and they answered thy servant our father [is] in good health he [is] yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance 29 and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mothers son and said [is] this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son 30 and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought [where] to weep and he entered into [his] chamber and wept there 31 and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread 32 and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves: because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that [is] an abomination unto the egyptians 33 and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another 34 and he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him chapter 44 1 and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks [with] food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth 2 and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken 3 as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses 4 [and] when they were gone out of the city [and] not [yet] far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good 5 [is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing 6 ∂ and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words 7 and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 8 behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold 9 with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen 10 and he said now also [let] it [be] according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless 11 then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack 12 and he searched [and] began at the eldest and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in benjamins sack 13 then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city 14 ∂ and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he [was] yet there: and they fell before him on the ground 15 and joseph said unto them what deed [is] this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine 16 and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we [are] my lords servants both we and [he] also with whom the cup is found 17 and he said god forbid that i should do so: [but] the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father 18 ∂ then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even as pharaoh 19 my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother 20 and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him 21 and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him 22 and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father: for [if] he should leave his father [his father] would die 23 and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more 24 and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord 25 and our father said go again [and] buy us a little food 26 and we said we cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down: for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother [be] with us 27 and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two [sons]: 28 and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since: 29 and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave 30 now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad [be] not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life 31 it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad [is] not [with us] that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave 32 for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever 33 now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren 34 for how shall i go up to my father and the lad [be] not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father chapter 45 1 then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren 2 and he wept aloud: and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard 3 and joseph said unto his brethren i [am] joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence 4 and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i [am] joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt 5 now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither: for god did send me before you to preserve life 6 for these two years [hath] the famine [been] in the land: and yet [there are] five years in the which [there shall] neither [be] earing nor harvest 7 and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance 8 so now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither but god: and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt 9 haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt: come down unto me tarry not: 10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast: 11 and there will i nourish thee for yet [there are] five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty 12 and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that [it is] my mouth that speaketh unto you 13 and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither 14 and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck 15 moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him 16 ∂ and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come: and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants 17 and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan 18 and take your father and your households and come unto me: and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land 19 now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come 20 also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt [is] yours 21 and the children of israel did so: and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way 22 to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver and five changes of raiment 23 and to his father he sent after this [manner] ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way 24 so he sent his brethren away and they departed: and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way 25 ∂ and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father 26 and told him saying joseph [is] yet alive and he [is] governor over all the land of egypt and jacobs heart fainted for he believed them not 27 and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived: 28 and israel said [it is] enough joseph my son [is] yet alive: i will go and see him before i die chapter 46 1 and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac 2 and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here [am] i 3 and he said i [am] god the god of thy father: fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation: 4 i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up [again]: and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes 5 and jacob rose up from beersheba: and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him 6 and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him: 7 his sons and his

goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while 30 and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou [art] yet alive 31 and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my fathers house which [were] in the land of canaan are come unto me 32 and the men [are] shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have 33 and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what [is] your occupation 34 that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we [and] also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd [is] an abomination unto the egyptians chapter 47 1 then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they [are] in the land of goshen 2 and he took some of his brethren [even] five men and presented them unto pharaoh 3 and pharaoh said unto his brethren what [is] your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants [are] shepherds both we [and] also our fathers 4 they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine [is] sore in the land of canaan: now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen 5 and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 6 the land of egypt [is] before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest [any] men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle 7 and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh: and jacob blessed pharaoh 8 and pharaoh said unto jacob how old [art] thou 9 and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage [are] an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage 10 and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh 11 ∂ and joseph placed his father and his brethren

household with bread according to [their] families 13 ∂ and [there was] no bread in all the land for the famine [was] very sore so that the land of egypt and [all] the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine 14 and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought: and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house 15 and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth 16 and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail 17 and they brought their cattle unto joseph: and joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year 18 when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide [it] from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands: 19 wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh: and give [us] seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate 20 and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became pharaohs 21 and as for the people he removed them to cities from [one] end of the borders of egypt even to the [other] end thereof 22 only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion [assigned them] of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands 23 then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh: lo [here is] seed for you and ye shall sow the land 24 and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth [part] unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones 25 and they said thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants 26 and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day [that] pharaoh should have the fifth [part] except the land of the priests only [which] became not pharaohs 27 ∂ and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly 28 and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years 29 and the time drew nigh that israel must die: and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt: 30 but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said 31 and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the beds head chapter 48 1 and it came to pass after these things that [one] told joseph behold thy father [is] sick: and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim 2 and [one] told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee: and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed 3 and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me 4 and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession 5 ∂ and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt [are] mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine 6 and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance 7 and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet [there was] but a little way to come unto ephrath: and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same [is] bethlehem 8 and israel beheld josephs sons and said who [are] these 9 and joseph said unto his father they [are] my sons whom god hath given me in this [place] and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them 10 now the eyes of israel were dim for age [so that] he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them 11 and israel said unto

took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought [them] near unto him 14 and israel stretched out his right hand and laid [it] upon ephraims head who [was] the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh [was] the firstborn 15 ∂ and he blessed joseph and said god before

of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth 17 and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him: and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head 18 and joseph said unto his father not so my father: for this [is] the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head 19 and his father refused and said i know [it] my son i know [it]: he also shall become a people and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations 20 and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh: and he set ephraim before manasseh 21 and israel said unto joseph behold i die: but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers 22 moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow chapter 49 1 and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the last days 2 gather

strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [god] of jacob (from thence [is] the shepherd the stone of israel:) 25 [even] by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb: 26 the blessings of thy father have

the cave that [is] therein [was] from the children of heth 33 and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people chapter 50 1 and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him 2 and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed israel 3 and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days 4 and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying 5 my father made me swear saying lo i die: in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again 6 and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear 7 ∂ and joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt 8 and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house: only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen 9 and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company 10 and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which [is] beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days 11 and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this [is] a grievous mourning to the egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which [is] beyond jordan 12 and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 13 for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre 14 ∂ and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father 15 ∂ and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all

brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil: and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him 18 and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we [be] thy servants 19 and joseph said unto them fear not: for [am] i in the place of god 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me [but] god meant it unto good to bring to pass as [it is] this day to save much people alive 21 now therefore fear ye not: i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them 22 ∂ and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house: and joseph lived an hundred and ten years 23 and joseph saw ephraims children of the third [generation]: the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon josephs knees 24 and joseph said unto his brethren i die: and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob 25 and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence 26 so joseph died [being] an hundred and ten years

$Daniel='the book of daniel chapter 1 1 in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it 2 and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god: which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god 3 ∂ and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring [certain] of the children of israel and of the kings seed and of the princes 4 children in whom [was] no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans 5 and the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king 6 now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah: 7 unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto daniel [the name] of belteshazzar and to hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of abednego 8 ∂ but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself 9 now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs 10 and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort then shall ye make [me] endanger my head to the king 11 then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah 12 prove thy servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink 13 then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings meat: and as thou seest deal with thy servants 14 so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days 15 and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the kings meat 16 thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse 17 ∂ as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams 18 now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar 19 and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah: therefore stood they before the king 20 and in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding that the king enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm 21 and daniel continued [even] unto the first year of king cyrus chapter 2 1 and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep brake from him 2 then the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king 3 and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream 4 then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live for ever: tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation 5 the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill 6 but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof 7 they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation of it 8 the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from me 9 but if ye will not make known unto me the dream [there is but] one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof 10 ∂ the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter: therefore [there is] no king lord nor ruler [that] asked such things at any magician or astrologer or chaldean 11 and [it is] a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh 12 for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise [men] of babylon 13 and the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain 14 ∂ then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise [men] of babylon: 15 he answered and said to arioch the kings captain why [is] the decree [so] hasty from the king then arioch made the thing known to daniel 16 then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation 17 then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishael and azariah his companions: 18 that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of babylon 19 ∂ then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven 20 daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: 21 and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding: 22 he revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him 23 i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known unto us the kings matter 24 ∂ therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of babylon: he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise [men] of babylon: bring me in before the king and i will shew unto the king the interpretation 25 then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation 26 the king answered and said to daniel whose name [was] belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof 27 daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise [men] the astrologers the magicians the soothsayers shew unto the king 28 but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these 29 as for thee o king thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass 30 but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that i have more than any living but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart 31 ∂ thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness [was] excellent stood before thee and the form thereof [was] terrible 32 this images head [was] of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass 33 his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay 34 thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay and brake them to pieces 35 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth 36 ∂ this [is] the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king 37 thou o king [art] a king of kings: for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory 38 and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou [art] this head of gold 39 and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth 40 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things]: and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise 41 and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay 42 and [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron and part of clay [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken 43 and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever 45 forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain and the interpretation thereof sure 46 ∂ then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him 47 the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth [it is] that your god [is] a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret 48 then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise [men] of babylon 49 then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon: but daniel [sat] in the gate of the king chapter 3 1 nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height [was] threescore cubits [and] the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon 2 then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up 3 then the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up 4 then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages 5 [that] at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: 6 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace 7 therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all the people the nations and the languages fell down [and] worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up 8 ∂ wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews 9 they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for ever 10 thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image: 11 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth [that] he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace 12 there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up 13 ∂ then nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king 14 nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them [is it] true o shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up 15 now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image which i have made [well]: but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who [is] that god that shall deliver you out of my hands 16 shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter 17 if it be [so] our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver [us] out of thine hand o king 18 but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up 19 ∂ then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego: [therefore] he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated 20 and he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace 21 then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their [other] garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace 22 therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego 23 and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace 24 then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste [and] spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true o king 25 he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god 26 ∂ then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace [and] spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come [hither] then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire 27 and the princes governors and captains and the kings counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them 28 [then] nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed [be] the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god 29 therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort 30 then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon chapter 4 1 nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you 2 i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me 3 how great [are] his signs and how mighty [are] his wonders his kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom and his dominion [is] from generation to generation 4 ∂ i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palace: 5 i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me 6 therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream 7 then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers: and i told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof 8 ∂ but at the last daniel came in before me whose name [was] belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him i told the dream [saying] 9 o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof 10 thus [were] the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof [was] great 11 the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 12 the leaves thereof [were] fair and the fruit thereof much and in it [was] meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed of it 13 i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven 14 he cried aloud and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from his branches: 15 nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 16 let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him 17 this matter [is] by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men 18 this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the wise [men] of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou [art] able for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee 19 ∂ then daniel whose name [was] belteshazzar was astonied for one hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream [be] to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies 20 the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth 21 whose leaves [were] fair and the fruit thereof much and in it [was] meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 22 it [is] thou o king that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth 23 and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him 24 this [is] the interpretation o king and this [is] the decree of the most high which is come upon my lord the king: 25 that they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will 26 and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule 27 wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity 28 ∂ all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar 29 at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon 30 the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majesty 31 while the word [was] in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven [saying] o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee 32 and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will 33 the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles [feathers] and his nails like birds [claws] 34 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion and his kingdom [is] from generation to generation: 35 and all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou 36 at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me 37 now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven all whose works [are] truth and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase chapter 5 1 belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand 2 belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which [was] in jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein 3 then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which [was] at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives and his concubines drank in them 4 they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone 5 ∂ in the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the kings palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote 6 then the kings countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another 7 the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers [and] the king spake and said to the wise [men] of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and [have] a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom 8 then came in all the kings wise [men]: but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof 9 then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonied 10 ∂ [now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: [and] the queen spake and said o king live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed: 11 there is a man in thy kingdom in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king [i say] thy father made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans [and] soothsayers 12 forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazzar: now let daniel be called and he will shew the interpretation 13 then was daniel brought in before the king [and] the king spake and said unto daniel [art] thou that daniel which [art] of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of jewry 14 i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods [is] in thee and [that] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee 15 and now the wise [men] the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: 16 and i have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and [have] a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom 17 ∂ then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation 18 o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honour: 19 and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down 20 but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him: 21 and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and [that] he appointeth over it whomsoever he will 22 and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this 23 but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know: and the god in whose hand thy breath [is] and whose [are] all thy ways hast thou not glorified: 24 then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written 25 ∂ and this [is] the writing that was written mene mene tekel upharsin 26 this [is] the interpretation of the thing: mene god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it 27 tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting 28 peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians 29 then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet and [put] a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom 30 ∂ in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain 31 and darius the median took the kingdom [being] about threescore and two years old chapter 6 1 it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdom 2 and over these three presidents of whom daniel [was] first: that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage 3 then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit [was] in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm 4 ∂ then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he [was] faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him 5 then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find [it] against him concerning the law of his god 6 then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him king darius live for ever 7 all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the counsellors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee o king he shall be cast into the den of lions 8 now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not 9 wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree 10 ∂ now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did aforetime 11 then these men assembled and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god 12 then they came near and spake before the king concerning the kings decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask [a petition] of any god or man within thirty days save of thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing [is] true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not 13 then answered they and said before the king that daniel which [is] of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day 14 then the king when he heard [these] words was sore displeased with himself and set [his] heart on daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him 15 then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the medes and persians [is] that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed 16 then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast [him] into the den of lions [now] the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee 17 and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel 18 ∂ then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him 19 then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions 20 and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel: [and] the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions 21 then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever 22 my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt 23 then was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god 24 ∂ and the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused daniel and they cast [them] into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den 25 ∂ then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you 26 i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel: for he [is] the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed and his dominion [shall be even] unto the end 27 he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions 28 so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign of cyrus the persian chapter 7 1 in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream [and] told the sum of the matters 2 daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea 3 and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another 4 the first [was] like a lion and had eagles wings: i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to it 5 and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and [it had] three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh 6 after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to it 7 after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were] before it and it had ten horns 8 i considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and behold in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things 9 ∂ i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment [was] white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne [was like] the fiery flame [and] his wheels [as] burning fire 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set and the books were opened 11 i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: i beheld [even] till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame 12 as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time 13 i saw in the night visions and behold [one] like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him 14 and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed 15 ∂ i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body and the visions of my head troubled me 16 i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things 17 these great beasts which are four [are] four kings [which] shall arise out of the earth 18 but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever 19 then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth [were of] iron and his nails [of] brass [which] devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet 20 and of the ten horns that [were] in his head and [of] the other which came up and before whom three fell even [of] that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look [was] more stout than his fellows 21 i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them 22 until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom 23 thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces 24 and the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings 25 and he shall speak [great] words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time 26 but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy [it] unto the end 27 and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him 28 hitherto [is] the end of the matter as for me daniel my cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me: but i kept the matter in my heart chapter 8 1 in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me [even unto] me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first 2 and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i [was] at shushan [in] the palace which [is] in the province of elam and i saw in a vision and i was by the river of ulai 3 then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high but one [was] higher than the other and the higher came up last 4 i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great 5 and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes 6 and he came to the ram that had [two] horns which i had seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power 7 and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand 8 therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven 9 and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant [land] 10 and it waxed great [even] to the host of heaven and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them 11 yea he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away and the place of his sanctuary was cast down 12 and an host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prospered 13 ∂ then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain [saint] which spake how long [shall be] the vision [concerning] the daily [sacrifice] and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot 14 and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed 15 ∂ and it came to pass when i [even] i daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man 16 and i heard a mans voice between [the banks of] ulai which called and said gabriel make this [man] to understand the vision 17 so he came near where i stood: and when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face: but he said unto me understand o son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] the vision 18 now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me and set me upright 19 and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shall be] 20 the ram which thou sawest having [two] horns [are] the kings of media and persia 21 and the rough goat [is] the king of grecia: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the first king 22 now that being broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power 23 and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up 24 and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people 25 and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand 26 and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision for it [shall be] for many days 27 and i daniel fainted and was sick [certain] days afterward i rose up and did the kings business and i was astonished at the vision but none understood [it] chapter 9 1 in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans 2 in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem 3 ∂ and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes: 4 and i prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments 5 we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: 6 neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land 7 o lord righteousness [belongeth] unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and unto all israel [that are] near and [that are] far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee 8 o lord to us [belongeth] confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee 9 to the lord our god [belong] mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against him 10 neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets 11 yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that [is] written in the law of moses the servant of god because we have sinned against him 12 and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem 13 as [it is] written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth 14 therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us: for the lord our god [is] righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice 15 and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly 16 ∂ o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain: because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people [are become] a reproach to all [that are] about us 17 now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lords sake 18 o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great mercies 19 o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name 20 ∂ and whiles i [was] speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god 21 yea whiles i [was] speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation 22 and he informed [me] and talked with me and said o daniel i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding 23 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to shew [thee] for thou [art] greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 24 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy 25 know therefore and understand [that] from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince [shall be] seven weeks and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times 26 and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof [shall be] with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make [it] desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate chapter 10 1 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing [was] true but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision 2 in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks 3 i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled 4 and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by the side of the great river which [is] hiddekel 5 then i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of uphaz: 6 his body also [was] like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude 7 and i daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves 8 therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength 9 yet heard i the voice of his words: and when i heard the voice of his words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground 10 ∂ and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands 11 and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright: for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling 12 then said he unto me fear not daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days: but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia 14 now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision [is] for [many] days 15 and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground and i became dumb 16 and behold [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i have retained no strength 17 for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither is there breath left in me 18 then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me 19 and said o man greatly beloved fear not: peace [be] unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me 20 then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia: and when i am gone forth lo the prince of grecia shall come 21 but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things but michael your prince chapter 11 1 also i in the first year of darius the mede [even] i stood to confirm and to strengthen him 2 and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia 3 and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will 4 and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those 5 ∂ and the king of the south shall be strong and [one] of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion [shall be] a great dominion 6 and in the end of years they shall join themselves together for the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm neither shall he stand nor his arm: but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in [these] times 7 but out of a branch of her roots shall [one] stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevail: 8 and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods with their princes [and] with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall continue [more] years than the king of the north 9 so the king of the south shall come into [his] kingdom and shall return into his own land 10 but his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and [one] shall certainly come and overflow and pass through: then shall he return and be stirred up [even] to his fortress 11 and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall come forth and fight with him [even] with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given into his hand 12 [and] when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up and he shall cast down [many] ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened [by it] 13 for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches 14 and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision but they shall fall 15 so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand neither his chosen people neither [shall there be any] strength to withstand 16 but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land which by his hand shall be consumed 17 he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her: but she shall not stand [on his side] neither be for him 18 after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause [it] to turn upon him 19 then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall and not be found 20 then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [in] the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battle 21 and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries 22 and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant 23 and after the league [made] with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people 24 he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do [that] which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil and riches: [yea] and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds even for a time 25 and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him 26 yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain 27 and both these kings hearts [shall be] to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper: for yet the end [shall be] at the time appointed 28 then shall he return into his land with great riches and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant and he shall do [exploits] and return to his own land 29 at the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter 30 ∂ for the ships of chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant 31 and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily [sacrifice] and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate 32 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do [exploits] 33 and they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by spoil [many] days 34 now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries 35 and [some] of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge and to make [them] white [even] to the time of the end: because [it is] yet for a time appointed 36 and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done 37 neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all 38 but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things 39 thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge [and] increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain 40 and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over 41 he shall enter also into the glorious land and many [countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand [even] edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon 42 he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of egypt shall not escape 43 but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of egypt: and the libyans and the ethiopians [shall be] at his steps 44 but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many 45 and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him chapter 12 1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book 2 and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt 3 and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book [even] to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased 5 ∂ then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river 6 and [one] said to the man clothed in linen which [was] upon the waters of the river how long [shall it be to] the end of these wonders 7 and i heard the man clothed in linen which [was] upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that [it shall be] for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these [things] shall be finished 8 and i heard but i understood not: then said i o my lord what [shall be] the end of these [things] 9 and he said go thy way daniel: for the words [are] closed up and sealed till the time of the end 10 many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand 11 and from the time [that] the daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up [there shall be] a thousand two hundred and ninety days 12 blessed [is] he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days 13 but go thou thy way till the end [be]: for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days

$Romans='the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans chapter 1 1 paul a servant of jesus christ called [to be] an apostle separated unto the gospel of god 2 (which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures) 3 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh 4 and declared [to be] the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead: 5 by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name: 6 among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ: 7 to all that be in rome beloved of god called [to be] saints: grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 8 first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world 9 for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers 10 making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you 11 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established 12 that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me 13 now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you (but was let hitherto) that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles 14 i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise 15 so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ: for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek 17 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith: as it is written the just shall live by faith 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed [it] unto them 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made [even] his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse: 21 because that when they knew god they glorified [him] not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in [their] knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful: 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them chapter 2 1 therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things 2 but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things 3 and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god 4 or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance 5 but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god 6 who will render to every man according to his deeds: 7 to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life: 8 but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath 9 tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile 10 but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile: 11 for there is no respect of persons with god 12 for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law 13 (for not the hearers of the law [are] just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified 14 for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves: 15 which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another) 16 in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel 17 behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god 18 and knowest [his] will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law 19 and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness 20 an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law 21 thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal 22 thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege 23 thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god 24 for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written 25 for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision 26 therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision 27 and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law 28 for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither [is that] circumcision which is outward in the flesh: 29 but he [is] a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision [is that] of the heart in the spirit [and] not in the letter whose praise [is] not of men but of god chapter 3 1 what advantage then hath the jew or what profit [is there] of circumcision 2 much every way: chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god 3 for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect 4 god forbid: yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged 5 but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say [is] god unrighteous who taketh vengeance (i speak as a man) 6 god forbid: for then how shall god judge the world 7 for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am i also judged as a sinner 8 and not [rather] (as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just 9 what then are we better [than they] no in no wise: for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin 10 as it is written there is none righteous no not one: 11 there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god 12 they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one 13 their throat [is] an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps [is] under their lips: 14 whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness: 15 their feet [are] swift to shed blood: 16 destruction and misery [are] in their ways: 17 and the way of peace have they not known: 18 there is no fear of god before their eyes 19 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god 20 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin 21 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets 22 even the righteousness of god [which is] by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god 24 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus: 25 whom god hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god 26 to declare [i say] at this time his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus 27 where [is] boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay: but by the law of faith 28 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law 29 [is he] the god of the jews only [is he] not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also: 30 seeing [it is] one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith 31 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid: yea we establish the law chapter 4 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found 2 for if abraham were justified by works he hath [whereof] to glory but not before god 3 for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness 4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt 5 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness 6 even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works 7 [saying] blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered 8 blessed [is] the man to whom the lord will not impute sin 9 [cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only] or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness 10 how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision 11 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised 13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith 14 for if they which are of the law [be] heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect: 15 because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is [there is] no transgression 16 therefore [it is] of faith that [it might be] by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all 17 (as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations) before him whom he believed [even] god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of saras womb: 20 he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god 21 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform 22 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness 23 now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him 24 but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead 25 who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification chapter 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ: 2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god 3 and not only [so] but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience 4 and patience experience and experience hope: 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us 6 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly 7 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us 9 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him 10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life 11 and not only [so] but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement 12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned: 13 (for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law 14 nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to come 15 but not as the offence so also [is] the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace [which is] by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many 16 and not as [it was] by one that sinned [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification 17 for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ) 18 therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life 19 for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous 20 moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound: 21 that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord chapter 6 1 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound 2 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein 3 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection: 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with [him] that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin 8 now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him: 9 knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him 10 for in that he died he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth he liveth unto god 11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof 13 neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto god 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law but under grace 15 what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid 16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness 17 but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you 18 being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness 19 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness 20 for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness 21 what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things [is] death 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life 23 for the wages of sin [is] death but the gift of god [is] eternal life through jesus christ our lord chapter 7 1 know ye not brethren (for i speak to them that know the law) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth 2 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of [her] husband 3 so then if while [her] husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man 4 wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another [even] to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god 5 for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death 6 but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not [in] the oldness of the letter 7 what shall we say then [is] the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law: for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet 8 but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin [was] dead 9 for i was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came sin revived and i died 10 and the commandment which [was ordained] to life i found [to be] unto death 11 for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew [me] 12 wherefore the law [is] holy and the commandment holy and just and good 13 was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful 14 for we know that the law is spiritual: but i am carnal sold under sin 15 for that which i do i allow not: for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i 16 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that [it is] good 17 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me 18 for i know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me but [how] to perform that which is good i find not 19 for the good that i would i do not: but the evil which i would not that i do 20 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me 21 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me 22 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man: 23 but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members 24 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death 25 i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin chapter 8 1 [there is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit 6 for to be carnally minded [is] death but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace 7 because the carnal mind [is] enmity against god: for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his 10 and if christ [be] in you the body [is] dead because of sin but the spirit [is] life because of righteousness 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die: but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god: 17 and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with [him] that we may be also glorified together 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god 20 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope 21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now 23 and not only [they] but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption [to wit] the redemption of our body 24 for we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for 25 but if we hope for that we see not [then] do we with patience wait for [it] 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered 27 and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] god 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to [his] purpose 29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called: and whom he called them he also justified: and whom he justified them he also glorified 31 what shall we then say to these things if god [be] for us who [can be] against us 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things 33 who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect [it is] god that justifieth 34 who [is] he that condemneth [it is] christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ [shall] tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord chapter 9 1 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost 2 that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart 3 for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh: 4 who are israelites to whom [pertaineth] the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service [of god] and the promises 5 whose [are] the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ [came] who is over all god blessed for ever amen 6 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they [are] not all israel which are of israel: 7 neither because they are the seed of abraham [are they] all children: but in isaac shall thy seed be called 8 that is they which are the children of the flesh these [are] not the children of god: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed 9 for this [is] the word of promise at this time will i come and sara shall have a son 10 and not only [this] but when rebecca also had conceived by one [even] by our father isaac 11 (for [the children] being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth) 12 it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger 13 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated 14 what shall we say then [is there] unrighteousness with god god forbid 15 for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion 16 so then [it is] not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy 17 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth 18 therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy] and whom he will he hardeneth 19 thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will 20 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it] why hast thou made me thus 21 hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour 22 [what] if god willing to shew [his] wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 23 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory 24 even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles 25 as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved 26 and it shall come to pass [that] in the place where it was said unto them ye [are] not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god 27 esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved: 28 for he will finish the work and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the lord make upon the earth 29 and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha 30 what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith 31 but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness 32 wherefore because [they sought it] not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone 33 as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed chapter 10 1 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved 2 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge 3 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god 4 for christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth 5 for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them 6 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven (that is to bring christ down [from above]:) 7 or who shall descend into the deep (that is to bring up christ again from the dead) 8 but what saith it the word is nigh thee [even] in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is the word of faith which we preach 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation 11 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed 12 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek: for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved 14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher 15 and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things 16 but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report 17 so then faith [cometh] by hearing and hearing by the word of god 18 but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world 19 but i say did not israel know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people [and] by a foolish nation i will anger you 20 but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me 21 but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people chapter 11 1 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham [of] the tribe of benjamin 2 god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying 3 lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life 4 but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] baal 5 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace 6 and if by grace then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace but if [it be] of works then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work 7 what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded 8 (according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear) unto this day 9 and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them: 10 let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway 11 i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy 12 now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness 13 for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office: 14 if by any means i may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh and might save some of them 15 for if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world what [shall] the receiving [of them be] but life from the dead 16 for if the firstfruit [be] holy the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy so [are] the branches 17 and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree 18 boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee 19 thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in 20 well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear: 21 for if god spared not the natural branches [take heed] lest he also spare not thee 22 behold therefore the goodness and severity of god: on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off 23 and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in: for god is able to graff them in again 24 for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these which be the natural [branches] be graffed into their own olive tree 25 for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in 26 and so all israel shall be saved: as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob: 27 for this [is] my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins 28 as concerning the gospel [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election [they are] beloved for the fathers sakes 29 for the gifts and calling of god [are] without repentance 30 for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 31 even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy 32 for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all 33 o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable [are] his judgments and his ways past finding out 34 for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor 35 or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again 36 for of him and through him and to him [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever amen chapter 12 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god [which is] your reasonable service 2 and be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what [is] that good and acceptable and perfect will of god 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith 4 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office: 5 so we [being] many are one body in christ and every one members one of another 6 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith 7 or ministry [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth on teaching 8 or he that exhorteth on exhortation: he that giveth [let him do it] with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness 9 [let] love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good 10 [be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another 11 not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord 12 rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer 13 distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality 14 bless them which persecute you: bless and curse not 15 rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep 16 [be] of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits 17 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men 18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written vengeance [is] mine i will repay saith the lord 20 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head 21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good chapter 13 1 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god: the powers that be are ordained of god 2 whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation 3 for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same: 4 for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of god a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil 5 wherefore [ye] must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake 6 for for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing 7 render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due] custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour 8 owe no man any thing but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law 9 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if [there be] any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law 11 and that knowing the time that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed 12 the night is far spent the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light 13 let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying 14 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof] chapter 14 1 him that is weak in the faith receive ye [but] not to doubtful disputations 2 for one believeth that he may eat all things: another who is weak eateth herbs 3 let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for god hath received him 4 who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up: for god is able to make him stand 5 one man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike] let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind 6 he that regardeth the day regardeth [it] unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard [it] he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks 7 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord: whether we live therefore or die we are the lords 9 for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living 10 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ 11 for it is written [as] i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god 12 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god 13 let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brothers way 14 i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him [it is] unclean 15 but if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died 16 let not then your good be evil spoken of: 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost 18 for he that in these things serveth christ [is] acceptable to god and approved of men 19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another 20 for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed [are] pure but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence 21 [it is] good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak 22 hast thou faith have [it] to thyself before god happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth 23 and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin chapter 15 1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves 2 let every one of us please [his] neighbour for [his] good to edification 3 for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me 4 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope 5 now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus: 6 that ye may with one mind [and] one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ 7 wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god 8 now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers: 9 and that the gentiles might glorify god for [his] mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name 10 and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people 11 and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people 12 and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust 13 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost 14 and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another 15 nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god 16 that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost 17 i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god 18 for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed 19 through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ 20 yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation: 21 but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand 22 for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you 23 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you 24 whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you: for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your [company] 25 but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints 26 for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem 27 it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things 28 when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain 29 and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ 30 now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in [your] prayers to god for me 31 that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which [i have] for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints 32 that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed 33 now the god of peace [be] with you all amen chapter 16 1 i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea: 2 that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also 3 greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus: 4 who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles 5 likewise [greet] the church that is in their house salute my wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ 6 greet mary who bestowed much labour on us 7 salute andronicus and junia my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me 8 greet amplias my beloved in the lord 9 salute urbane our helper in christ and stachys my beloved 10 salute apelles approved in christ salute them which are of aristobulus [household] 11 salute herodion my kinsman greet them that be of the [household] of narcissus which are in the lord 12 salute tryphena and tryphosa who labour in the lord salute the beloved persis which laboured much in the lord 13 salute rufus chosen in the lord and his mother and mine 14 salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the brethren which are with them 15 salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints which are with them 16 salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ salute you 17 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them 18 for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple 19 for your obedience is come abroad unto all [men] i am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil 20 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ [be] with you amen 21 timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you 22 i tertius who wrote [this] epistle salute you in the lord 23 gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and quartus a brother 24 the grace of our lord jesus christ [be] with you all amen 25 now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began 26 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 27 to god only wise [be] glory through jesus christ for ever amen <∂ written to the romans from corinthus [and sent] by phebe servant of the church at cenchrea> ';
$Revelation='the revelation of saint john the divine chapter 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant john: 2 who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw 3 blessed [is] he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein: for the time [is] at hand 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia: grace [be] unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne 5 and from jesus christ [who is] the faithful witness [and] the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood 6 and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever amen 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they [also] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ 10 i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet 11 saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last: and what thou seest write in a book and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea 12 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle 14 his head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool as white as snow and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire 15 and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last: 18 i [am] he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death 19 write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter 20 the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches chapter 2 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks 2 i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars: 3 and hast borne and hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted 4 nevertheless i have [somewhat] against thee because thou hast left thy first love 5 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent 6 but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god 8 and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive 9 i know thy works and tribulation and poverty (but thou art rich) and [i know] the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but [are] the synagogue of satan 10 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges 13 i know thy works and where thou dwellest [even] where satans seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas [was] my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth 14 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication 15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate 16 repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth 17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it] 18 and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet [are] like fine brass 19 i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last [to be] more than the first 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols 21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not 22 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds 23 and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and i will give unto every one of you according to your works 24 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden 25 but that which ye have [already] hold fast till i come 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations: 27 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as i received of my father 28 and i will give him the morning star 29 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches chapter 3 1 and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead 2 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die: for i have not found thy works perfect before god 3 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee 4 thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels 6 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth 8 i know thy works: behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name 9 behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee 10 because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth 11 behold i come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out: and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god [which is] new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god: and [i will write upon him] my new name 13 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god 15 i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot: i would thou wert cold or hot 16 so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth 17 because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked: 18 i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and [that] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore and repent 20 behold i stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne 22 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches chapter 4 1 after this i looked and behold a door [was] opened in heaven: and the first voice which i heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter 2 and immediately i was in the spirit: and behold a throne was set in heaven and [one] sat on the throne 3 and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald 4 and round about the throne [were] four and twenty seats: and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god 6 and before the throne [there was] a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne [were] four beasts full of eyes before and behind 7 and the first beast [was] like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast [was] like a flying eagle 8 and the four beasts had each of them six wings about [him] and [they were] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come 9 and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever 10 the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying 11 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created chapter 5 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals 2 and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof 3 and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon 4 and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon 5 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not: behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth 7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne 8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four [and] twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints 9 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation 10 and hast made us unto our god kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth 11 and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands 12 saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever 14 and the four beasts said amen and the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever chapter 6 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see 2 and i saw and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering and to conquer 3 and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see 4 and there went out another horse [that was] red: and [power] was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword 5 and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand 6 and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine 7 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see 8 and i looked and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held: 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they [were] should be fulfilled 12 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood 13 and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind 14 and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places 15 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains 16 and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb: 17 for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand chapter 7 1 and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree 2 and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea 3 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads 4 and i heard the number of them which were sealed: [and there were] sealed an hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel 5 of the tribe of juda [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad [were] sealed twelve thousand 6 of the tribe of aser [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of nepthalim [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses [were] sealed twelve thousand 7 of the tribe of simeon [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar [were] sealed twelve thousand 8 of the tribe of zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand 9 after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands 10 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb 11 and all the angels stood round about the throne and [about] the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god 12 saying amen: blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might [be] unto our god for ever and ever amen 13 and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they 14 and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb 15 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them 16 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes chapter 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour 2 and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets 3 and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne 4 and the smoke of the incense [which came] with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angels hand 5 and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake 6 and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound 7 the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up 8 and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood 9 and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed 10 and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters 11 and the name of the star is called wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter 12 and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise 13 and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound chapter 9 1 and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit 2 and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit 3 and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power 4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads 5 and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man 6 and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them 7 and the shapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold and their faces [were] as the faces of men 8 and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions 9 and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle 10 and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months 11 and they had a king over them [which is] the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue [is] abaddon but in the greek tongue hath [his] name apollyon 12 one woe is past [and] behold there come two woes more hereafter 13 and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god 14 saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates 15 and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men 16 and the number of the army of the horsemen [were] two hundred thousand thousand: and i heard the number of them 17 and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone 18 by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths 19 for their power is in their mouth and in their tails: for their tails [were] like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt 20 and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood: which neither can see nor hear nor walk: 21 neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts chapter 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head and his face [was] as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire: 2 and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea and [his] left [foot] on the earth 3 and cried with a loud voice as [when] a lion roareth: and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices 4 and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write: and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven 6 and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer: 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth 9 and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take [it] and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey 10 and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings chapter 11 1 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein 2 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty [and] two months 3 and i will give [power] unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days clothed in sackcloth 4 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth 5 and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed 6 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will 7 and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them 8 and their dead bodies [shall lie] in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified 9 and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves 10 and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth 11 and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them 12 and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them 13 and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven 14 the second woe is past [and] behold the third woe cometh quickly 15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever 16 and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god 17 saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned 18 and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth 19 and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail chapter 12 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 2 and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered 3 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads 4 and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born 5 and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto god and [to] his throne 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days 7 and there was war in heaven: michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels 8 and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven 9 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him 10 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death 12 therefore rejoice [ye] heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time 13 and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child] 14 and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent 15 and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood 16 and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth 17 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ chapter 13 1 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy 2 and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority 3 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast 4 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast saying who [is] like unto the beast who is able to make war with him 5 and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months 6 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven 7 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world 9 if any man have an ear let him hear 10 he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints 11 and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon 12 and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed 13 and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men 14 and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live 15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed 16 and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads: 17 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name 18 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man and his number [is] six hundred threescore [and] six chapter 14 1 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads 2 and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder: and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 3 and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand which were redeemed from the earth 4 these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men [being] the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb 5 and in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of god 6 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people 7 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters 8 and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication 9 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive [his] mark in his forehead or in his hand 10 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb: 11 and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name 12 here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus 13 and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed [are] the dead which die in the lord from henceforth: yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow them 14 and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle 15 and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe 16 and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped 17 and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle 18 and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe 19 and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of god 20 and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand [and] six hundred furlongs chapter 15 1 and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god 2 and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark [and] over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god 3 and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous [are] thy works lord god almighty just and true [are] thy ways thou king of saints 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for [thou] only [art] holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest 5 and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 6 and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles 7 and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever 8 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled chapter 16 1 and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth 2 and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and [upon] them which worshipped his image 3 and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea 4 and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood 5 and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus 6 for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy 7 and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous [are] thy judgments 8 and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire 9 and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory 10 and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain 11 and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds 12 and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared 13 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet 14 for they are the spirits of devils working miracles [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty 15 behold i come as a thief blessed [is] he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame 16 and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon 17 and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done 18 and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake [and] so great 19 and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell: and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath 20 and every island fled away and the mountains were not found 21 and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great chapter 17 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: 2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication 3 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns 4 and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: 5 and upon her forehead [was] a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth 6 and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus: and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration 7 and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns 8 the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is 9 and here [is] the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth 10 and there are seven kings: five are fallen and one is [and] the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space 11 and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition 12 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast 13 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast 14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them: for he is lord of lords and king of kings: and they that are with him [are] called and chosen and faithful 15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues 16 and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire 17 for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled 18 and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth chapter 18 1 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory 2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird 3 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues 5 for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities 6 reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double 7 how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow 8 therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the lord god who judgeth her 9 and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning 10 standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come 11 and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 12 the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble 13 and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men 14 and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all 15 the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing 16 and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls 17 for in one hour so great riches is come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off 18 and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what [city is] like unto this great city 19 and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate 20 rejoice over her [thou] heaven and [ye] holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her 21 and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast [it] into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all 22 and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft [he be] shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee 23 and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth chapter 19 1 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god: 2 for true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand 3 and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever 4 and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia 5 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great 6 and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia: for the lord god omnipotent reigneth 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him: for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready 8 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints 9 and he saith unto me write blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god 10 and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see [thou do it] not: i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus: worship god: for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy 11 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him [was] called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war 12 his eyes [were] as a flame of fire and on his head [were] many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself 13 and he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called the word of god 14 and the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean 15 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god 16 and he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords 17 and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god 18 that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all [men both] free and bond both small and great 19 and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army 20 and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone 21 and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh chapter 20 1 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand 2 and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years 3 and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season 4 and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them: and [i saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years 5 but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this [is] the first resurrection 6 blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years 7 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison 8 and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea 9 and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city: and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet [are] and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever 11 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them 12 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened: and another book was opened which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works 13 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death 15 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire chapter 21 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god [is] with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them [and be] their god 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write: for these words are true and faithful 6 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god 11 having the glory of god: and her light [was] like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal 12 and had a wall great and high [and] had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of israel: 13 on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates 14 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb 15 and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof 16 and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal 17 and he measured the wall thereof an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits [according to] the measure of a man that is of the angel 18 and the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold like unto clear glass 19 and the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation [was] jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald 20 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst 21 and the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city [was] pure gold as it were transparent glass 22 and i saw no temple therein: for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it: for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb [is] the light thereof 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there 26 and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it 27 and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither [whatsoever] worketh abomination or [maketh] a lie: but they which are written in the lambs book of life chapter 22 1 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb 2 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river [was there] the tree of life which bare twelve [manner of] fruits [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations 3 and there shall be no more curse: but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him: 4 and they shall see his face and his name [shall be] in their foreheads 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever 6 and he said unto me these sayings [are] faithful and true: and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 7 behold i come quickly: blessed [is] he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 8 and i john saw these things and heard [them] and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 9 then saith he unto me see [thou do it] not: for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship god 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous let him be righteous still: and he that is holy let him be holy still 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward [is] with me to give every man according as his work shall be 13 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last 14 blessed [are] they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city 15 for without [are] dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david [and] the bright and morning star 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and [from] the things which are written in this book 20 he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ [be] with you all amen';
$Ephesians='the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians chapter 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus: 2 grace [be] to you and peace from god our father and [from] the lord jesus christ 3 blessed [be] the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in christ: 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 10 that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth [even] in him: 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ 13 in whom ye also [trusted] after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory 15 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints 16 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints 19 and what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places] 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come: 22 and hath put all [things] under his feet and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church 23 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all chapter 2 1 and you [hath he quickened] who were dead in trespasses and sins 2 wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 3 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ (by grace ye are saved) 6 and hath raised [us] up together and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in christ jesus: 7 that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through christ jesus 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of god: 9 not of works lest any man should boast 10 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them 11 wherefore remember that ye [being] in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands 12 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world: 13 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ 14 for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us] 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man [so] making peace 16 and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby: 17 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh 18 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god 20 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner [stone] 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord: 22 in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit chapter 3 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles 2 if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward: 3 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery (as i wrote afore in few words 4 whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ) 5 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit 6 that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel: 7 whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power 8 unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ 9 and to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ: 10 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord: 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him 13 wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory 14 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ 15 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love 18 may be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height 19 and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god 20 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us 21 unto him [be] glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen chapter 4 1 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called 2 with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love 3 endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace 4 [there is] one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling 5 one lord one faith one baptism 6 one god and father of all who [is] above all and through all and in you all 7 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men 9 (now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things) 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers 12 for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ: 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ: 14 that we [henceforth] be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men [and] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head [even] christ: 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love 17 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind 18 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart: 19 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness 20 but ye have not so learned christ 21 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus: 22 that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind 24 and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another 26 be ye angry and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 27 neither give place to the devil 28 let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour working with [his] hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption 31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice: 32 and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you chapter 5 1 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children 2 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour 3 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints 4 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks 5 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god 6 let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience 7 be not ye therefore partakers with them 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now [are ye] light in the lord: walk as children of light: 9 (for the fruit of the spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth) 10 proving what is acceptable unto the lord 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove [them] 12 for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret 13 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light 15 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise 16 redeeming the time because the days are evil 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord [is] 18 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit 19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord 20 giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body 24 therefore as the church is subject unto christ so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church: 30 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh 32 this is a great mystery: but i speak concerning christ and the church 33 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband chapter 6 1 children obey your parents in the lord: for this is right 2 honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise) 3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth 4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord 5 servants be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ 6 not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart 7 with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men: 8 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether [he be] bond or free 9 and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening: knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might 11 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high [places] 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand 14 stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness 15 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace 16 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god: 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints 19 and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel 20 for which i am an ambassador in bonds: that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak 21 but that ye also may know my affairs [and] how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things: 22 whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and [that] he might comfort your hearts 23 peace [be] to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ 24 grace [be] with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen <∂ written from rome unto the ephesians by tychicus>';
